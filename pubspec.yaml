# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+VERSIONCODE
# 
# Versioning Rules:
# - MAJOR: Tăng khi có thay đổi lớn, không tương thích ngược (VD: 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
# - MINOR: Tăng khi thêm tính năng mới, vẫn tương thích (VD: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
# - PATCH: Tăng khi sửa lỗi, cải thiện nhỏ (VD: 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
# - VERSIONCODE: Phải tăng mỗi lần build, không được giảm (VD: +1 -> +2 -> +3)
#
# Examples:
#   1.0.0+1  - Bản đầu tiên
#   1.0.1+2  - Sửa bug (patch)
#   1.1.0+3  - Thêm tính năng mới (minor)
#   2.0.0+4  - Update lớn, thay đổi API (major)
#
# In Android: versionName = MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, versionCode = VERSIONCODE
# In iOS: CFBundleShortVersionString = MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, CFBundleVersion = VERSIONCODE
version: 1.0.5+6

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
